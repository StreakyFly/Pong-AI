# Pong AI
Pong game and NEAT AI.

YouTube video about the creation process and training: TBD

Game can be started by running the RunPong.py file. "Modes" (AI vs. AI, Player vs. AI, Player vs. Player, etc.) can be changed by simply commenting/uncommenting lines at the end of the file (yes, a start menu has not been made yet).

Huge thanks to Tech with Tim for sharing his NEAT Pong implementation (pun intended): https://github.com/techwithtim/NEAT-Pong-Python
